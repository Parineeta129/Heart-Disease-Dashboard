Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard – Power BI
1. Project Title
Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard Using Power BI

2. Short Description
This project demonstrates the development of a dynamic and interactive Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard transforms raw clinical data into meaningful insights that help understand patient survival trends, key medical indicators, and major health risk factors affecting patient outcomes.

3. Objective
Analyze heart failure clinical records
Visualize patient survival patterns
Identify critical risk factors influencing mortality
Support data-driven healthcare decision-making

4. Tech Stack
Power BI – Data modeling, DAX, dashboard development
Microsoft Excel – Data source and preprocessing
Canva – Custom dashboard background design
GitHub – Project documentation and version control

5. Data Source
Dataset: Heart Failure Clinical Records

6. Features and Highlights
6.1 KPI Overview
Survival Rate
Average Age of Survival
Total Survivors
Total Deaths

6.2 Analytical Visuals
Survival Count and Average Serum Creatinine by Age Group:
Identifies correlation between kidney function and patient survival
Reveals age-based outcome patterns

Survival Count and Average Ejection Fraction by Age Group:
Analyzes heart performance among survivors
Shows how cardiac efficiency varies across age categories

Survival Rate by Age Group:
Highlights age-related mortality risk
Supports early identification of vulnerable age groups

Risk Factor Impact Analysis (Ribbon Chart):
Compares smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, and anaemia
Demonstrates the contribution of each risk factor across age groups

Gender-Based Filtering: Enables comparative outcome analysis between male and female patients

7. Business Impact and Insights
Identifies high-risk age groups for targeted healthcare intervention
Highlights key medical indicators influencing patient survival
Supports preventive healthcare planning
Strengthens clinical and operational decision-making

8. Project Coverage
Data ingestion and preparation
KPI development and validation
DAX-based data modeling
Interactive visual design
Professional dashboard structuring
