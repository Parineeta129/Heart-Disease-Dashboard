❤️ Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard – Power BI 
📊Project Title
Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard Using Power BI

1. Short Description
This project focuses on building a dynamic and interactive Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard converts raw clinical data into meaningful insights to understand patient survival trends, key medical indicators, and major health risk factors affecting patient outcomes.

2. Objective
Analyze heart failure clinical records
Visualize patient survival patterns
Identify critical risk factors influencing mortality
Support data-driven healthcare decision-making

3. Tech Stack
Power BI – Data modeling, DAX, dashboard development
Microsoft Excel – Data source and preprocessing
Canva – Custom dashboard background design
GitHub – Project documentation and version control

4. Data Source
Dataset: Heart Failure Clinical Records
Repository: UCI Machine Learning Repository

5. Features and Highlights
KPI Overview
Survival Rate:
Average Age of Survival
Total Survivors
Total Deaths

6. Analytical Visuals
6.1 Survival Count and Average Serum Creatinine by Age Group:
Identifies correlation between kidney function and patient survival and reveals age-based outcome patterns.

6.2 Survival Count and Average Ejection Fraction by Age Group:
Analyzes heart performance among survivors and shows how cardiac efficiency varies across age categories.

6.3 Survival Rate by Age Group:
Highlights age-related mortality risk and supports early identification of vulnerable age groups.

6.4 Risk Factor Impact Analysis (Ribbon Chart):
Compares smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, and anaemia, demonstrating the contribution of each risk factor across age groups.

Gender-Based Filtering
Enables comparative outcome analysis between male and female patients.

7. Business Impact and Insights
Identifies high-risk age groups for targeted healthcare intervention
Highlights key medical indicators influencing patient survival
Supports preventive healthcare planning
Strengthens clinical and operational decision-making

8. Project Coverage
Data ingestion and preparation
KPI development and validation
DAX-based data modeling
Interactive visual design
